#Setting Up in Unity
Open Unity 5.2.x and navigate to the folder which this is contained in. 
Select "TBDdev1.0" and hit the "Select folder" button. 
Unity should auto-compile all assets and open up the "DevRoom" scene.

If this isn't the case, go to |File -> Open Scene| and then navigate
to the "DevRoom" Scene in the Assets/_Scenes directory.

If the input is setup correctly, you should be able to move the
character capsule with WASD and the camera with arrow keys after pressing
the play button at the top of the editor. To stop the game, simply press the
play button again.

If you want to change the input go to |Edit->Project Settings -> Input|.
"Horizontal" and "Vertical" are used for character movement, and
"HorizontalR" and "VerticalR" are used for camera movement.
